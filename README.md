# Building AI Model to Detect Visual Pollution Objects
## This project focuses on building an AI model using YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect visual pollution objects in images. The model is trained to identify specific classes of visual pollution and provide bounding box coordinates for each detected object.

## Usage
To run this project, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
$ git clone [repository URL]


## Run the project:
In your terminal or command prompt, execute the following command to start the Flask server and launch the web interface:
Copy code
python project.py
This will start the project and open the web interface, allowing you to upload images and detect visual pollution objects using the trained AI model.
Please ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed before running this project.
